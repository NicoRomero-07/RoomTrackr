# B7abiertosREST

The B7abiertosREST API  aims to provide a easier interface to work with both AEMET OpenData and Malaga's OpenData API. It provides endpoints to:

* Retrieve a bus location given its bus code.
* Retrieve a bus stop given its stop code.
* Proximity search for both bus and stop locations.
* Weather forecast given a day.
